Javadoc is a tool used to generate API documentation in HTML format from comments written in Java source code.
Here are some of the formatting options that can be used to write code documentation with Javadoc:

- **Method and class descriptions**: 
Use the "@param", "@return", "@throws", and "@see" tags to describe methods and classes.
- **Inline code snippets**: 
Enclose inline code snippets with the "{@code ...}" tag.
- **Code blocks**: 
Use the "{@code ...}" tag to enclose code blocks that span multiple lines.
- **Links**: 
Use the "{@link ...}" tag to create links to other classes, methods, or fields in the same package.
- **Lists**: 
Use the "{@literal *}" tag to create bulleted or numbered lists.
- **HTML tags**: 
You can use standard HTML tags to format text in your comments.
- **Annotations**: 
Javadoc supports annotations to mark up code for documentation, such as "@Deprecated" to indicate that a method or class should no longer be used.
