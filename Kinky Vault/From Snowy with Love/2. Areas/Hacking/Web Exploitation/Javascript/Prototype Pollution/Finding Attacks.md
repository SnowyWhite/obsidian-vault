## Finding  sources manually

Finding [prototype pollution sources](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution/what-is-prototype-pollution#prototype-pollution-sources) manually is largely a case of trial and error. 
In short, you need to try different ways of adding an arbitrary property to the `Object.prototype` until you find a source that works. 

This involves the following high-level steps:

1.  Try to inject an arbitrary property via the query string, URL fragment, and any web message data. For example:
    `vulnerable-website.com/?__proto__[foo]=bar`

2.  In your browser console, inspect the `Object.prototype` to see if you have successfully polluted it with your arbitrary property:
    `Object.prototype.foo // "bar" indicates that you have successfully polluted the prototype // undefined indicates that the attack was not successful`

3.  If the property was not added to the global prototype, try using different techniques, such as switching to dot notation rather than bracket notation, or vice versa:
    `vulnerable-website.com/?__proto__.foo=bar`

4.  Repeat this process for each potential source.

## Finding prototype pollution gadgets manually

Once you've identified a source that lets you add arbitrary properties to the global prototype, the next step is to find a suitable gadget that you can use to craft an exploit. In practice, we recommend [using DOM Invader](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution/finding#finding-prototype-pollution-gadgets-using-dom-invader) to do this, but it's useful to look at the manual process as it may help solidify your understanding of the vulnerability.

1.  Look through the source code and identify any properties that are used by the application or any libraries that it imports.
2.  In Burp, enable response interception (**Proxy > Options > Intercept server responses**) and intercept the response containing the JavaScript that you want to test.
3.  Add a `debugger` statement at the start of the script, then forward any remaining requests and responses.
4.  In Burp's browser, go to the page on which the target script is loaded. The `debugger` statement pauses execution of the script.
5.  While the script is still paused, switch to the console and enter the following command, replacing `YOUR-PROPERTY` with one of the properties that you think is a potential gadget:
    `Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'YOUR-PROPERTY', { get() { console.trace(); return 'polluted'; } })`
    The property is added to the global `Object.prototype`, and the browser will log a stack trace to the console whenever it is accessed.
6.  Press the button to continue execution of the script and monitor the console. If a stack trace appears, this confirms that the property was accessed somewhere within the application.
7.  Expand the stack trace and use the provided link to jump to the line of code where the property is being read.
8.  Using the browser's debugger controls, step through each phase of execution to see if the property is passed to a sink, such as `innerHTML` or `eval()`.
9.  Repeat this process for any properties that you think are potential gadgets.

## Prototype pollution via the constructor

So far, we've looked exclusively at how you can get a reference to global prototypes via the special `__proto__` accessor property. As this is the classic technique for prototype pollution, a common defense is to strip any properties with the key `__proto__` from user-controlled objects before merging them. This approach is flawed as there are alternative ways to reference the `Object.prototype` without relying on the `__proto__` string at all.

Unless its [prototype is set to `null`](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution/preventing#prevent-an-object-from-inheriting-properties), every JavaScript object has a `constructor` property, which contains a reference to the constructor function that was used to create it. For example, you can create a new object either using literal syntax or by explicitly invoking the `Object()` constructor as follows:

`let myObjectLiteral = {}; let myObject = new Object();`

You can then reference the `Object()` constructor via the built-in `constructor` property:

`myObjectLiteral.constructor // function Object(){...} myObject.constructor // function Object(){...}`

Remember that functions are also just objects under the hood. Each constructor function has a `prototype` property, which points to the prototype that will be assigned to any objects that are created by this constructor. As a result, you can also access any object's prototype as follows:

`myObject.constructor.prototype // Object.prototype myString.constructor.prototype // String.prototype myArray.constructor.prototype // Array.prototype`

As `myObject.constructor.prototype` is equivalent to `myObject.__proto__`, this provides an alternative vector for prototype pollution.

## Prototype pollution in external libraries

As we've touched on already, prototype pollution gadgets may occur in third-party libraries that are imported by the application. In this case, we strongly recommend using DOM Invader's prototype pollution features to identify sources and gadgets. Not only is this much quicker, it also ensures you won't miss vulnerabilities that would otherwise be extremely tricky to notice.
