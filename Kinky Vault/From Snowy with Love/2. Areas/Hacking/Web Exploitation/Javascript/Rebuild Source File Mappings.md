- In DevTools, go to the 3 dots in the upper right corner and select `More Tools` and then `Search`
- Use the Search tool to look out for "Loading Chunk"
- Found code should look something like this:

```js
d.src = function(n) {
    return i.p + "assets/" + ({
        0: "UserNameComplete",
        1: "ActivateDone",
        2: "EmailVerificationDone"
    }[n] || n) + "-" + {
        0: "d6c0c7fc8bc309d9b022",
        1: "b05564267e6ac2c8cf9c",
        2: "b41e54cddac2a06ec87a"
    }[n] + ".js"
}(n),

r = function(t) {
    d.onerror = d.onload = null,
    clearTimeout(c);
    var e = a[n];
    if (0 !== e) {
        if (e) {
            var o = t && ("load" === t.type ? "missing" : t.type)
              , r = t && t.target && t.target.src
              , i = new Error("Loading chunk " + n + " failed.\n(" + o + ": " + r + ")");
            i.type = o,
            i.request = r,
            e[1](i)
        }
        a[n] = void 0
    }
};
```

- Then the function can be refactored using the DevTools console (and also add a `.map` extension to the file URL):

- Now having the URLs for the source maps it is possible to revert the process and restore the original code with help of this tool: https://github.com/rarecoil/unwebpack-sourcemap

```python
python3 unwebpack_sourcemap.py --make-directory https://example.com/assets/UserNameComplete-d6c0c7fc8bc309d9b022.js.map output
```

- The result will look like this when all source maps were processed:

- A BurpSuite extension that forces the browser to decode hidden map files would be this: https://github.com/BitTheByte/BitMapper
