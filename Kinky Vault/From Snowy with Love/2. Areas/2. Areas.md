# Overview
 
> [!NOTE]
> This folder is supposed to manage all sort of things that uphold over long periods, I only use it for technical stuff though.
> - Areas are **personal** to you. They are for everything that is not a project but is longer-term and still something to work toward.
> - Areas are often the overhead in the background (maintenance, support, administration, etc.) that need to be done but are not projects.
