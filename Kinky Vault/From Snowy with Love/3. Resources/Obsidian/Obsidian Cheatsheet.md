## Supported formats for internal links

Obsidian supports the following link formats:

-   Wikilink: `[[Three laws of motion]]`
-   Markdown: `[Three laws of motion](Three%20laws%20of%20motion.md)`

The examples above are equivalentâ€”they appear the same way in the editor, and links to the same note.
By default, due to its more compact format, Obsidian generates links using the Wikilink format. 
If interoperability is important to you, you can disable Wikilinks and use Markdown links instead.

To use the Markdown format:

1.  Open **Settings**.
2.  Under **Files & Links**, disable **Use \[\[Wikilink\]\]**.

Even if you disable the Wikilink format, you can still autocomplete links by typing two square brackets `[[`. 
When you select one of the suggested files, Obsidian instead generates a Markdown link.

## Link to a file

To create a link while in Editing view, use either of the following ways:

-   Type `[[` in the editor and then select the file you want to create a link to.
-   Select text in the editor and then type `[[`.
-   Open the [Command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette) and then select **Add internal link**.

While you can link to any of the [accepted file formats](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Accepted+file+formats), links to file formats other than Markdown needs to include a file extension, such as `[[Figure 1.png]]`.

## Link to a heading in a note

You can link to specific headings in notes, also known as _anchor links_.

To link to a heading, add a hashtag (`#`) at the end of the link destination, followed by the heading text.

For example, `[[Three laws of motion#Second law]]`.

You can add multiple hashtags for each subheading.

For example, `[[My note#Heading 1#Heading 2]]`.

## Link to a block in a note

A block is a unit of text in your note, for example a paragraph, block quote, or even a list item.

You can link to a block by adding `#^` at the end of your link destination followed by a unique block identifier, for example, `[[2023-01-01#^37066d]]`.

Fortunately, you don't need to know the identifier. When you type the caret (`^`), you can select the block from a list of suggestions to insert the right identifier.

You can also create human-readable block identifiers by adding `^quote-of-the-day` at the end of a block. Note the blank space before the caret. Now you can instead link to the block by typing `[[2023-01-01#^quote-of-the-day]]`.

Block identifiers can only consist of letters, numbers, and dashes.

## Change the link display text

You can change the text used to display a link. This can be useful when you want to work a link into a sentence without using the name of the file.

**Wikilink format:**

You can use the vertical bar (`|`) to change the text used to display a link.

For example, `[[Internal links|custom display text]]` appears as [custom display text](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links).

**Markdown format:**

Enter the display text between the square brackets (`[]`).

For example, `[custom display text](Internal%20links.md)` appears as [custom display text](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links).
