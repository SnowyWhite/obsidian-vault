# Overview

Hey ðŸ‘‹

This is the vault structure I personally use together with all the notes where I suppose they could be useful for you as well.
The structure is loosely based on the PARA method.
You can learn more about it here: https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/

> [!abstract]
> PARA is based on a simple observation: that there are only four categories that encompass all the information in your life:
> - You have **projects** youâ€™re actively working on â€“ short-term efforts (in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind.
> - You have **areas** of responsibility â€“ important parts of your work and life that require ongoing attention.
> - Then you have **resources** on a range of topics youâ€™re interested in and learning about.
> - Finally, you have **archives**, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active, but you might want to save for future reference.

To create overviews of a folder just like the one you're reading right now seems to be either buggy or I am dumb.
Well, anyway, I do it by first creating a folder, then clicking on a normal note, have it in editing mode and then clicking back to the newly created folder.
This way it will also appear in editing mode.
Just click a bit forth and back if it doesn't happen on first try.
